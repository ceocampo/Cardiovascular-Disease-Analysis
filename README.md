# Heart-Health-ML-Models

In this notebook, I take a look at a dataset containing 70,000 entries of patients' medical information such as height, weight, age, blood pressure, glucose levels, and cholesterol levels.

The goal of this project is to use these features in order to make predictions of a patient having cardiovascular disease.
Several classification models will be investigated in this project.
