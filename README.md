# Heart-Health-ML-Models

In this notebook, I take a look at a dataset containing 70,000 entries of patients' medical information such as height, weight, age, blood pressure, glucose levels, and cholesterol levels.

The goal of this project is to use these features to make predictions of the presence of cardiovascular disease in patients.
Several classification models will be investigated in this project.

The models investigated were random forest, SVM, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, and XGBoost. Each models was subjected to k-fold cross validation. The model with the highest accuracy was XGBoost, yielding a 73.7% accuracy.

This repository includes the .ipynb notebook file as well as the data csv file.

<b>Technologies used for this project:</b> python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
